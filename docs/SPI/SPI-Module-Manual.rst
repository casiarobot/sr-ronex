This section will tell you everything you need to know to get started
with an SPI module, including the interfaces provided and various ways
to interact with the module through said interfaces.

Here's a link to the [[SPI
datasheet\|https://www.shadowrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014-06\_RoNeX\_SPI\_Datasheet.pdf]].

Precursor: General RoNeX Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting with the SPI module, you will need to run through the
General RoNeX setup procedures in the sections listed on the [[General
RoNeX Setup\|General-RoNeX-Setup]] page.

SPI Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~

familiarise yourself with the SPI module.

First of all let's have a look through the interfaces the SPI module
provides in the [[SPI Module System
Overview\|SPI-Module-System-Overview]].
